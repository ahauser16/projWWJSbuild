# Project WhereWoof 

### Project Overview
###### Project WhereWoof is a social media platform for dog owners who want to extend their dog's social circle using match-making features using a dog's criteria such as breed, temperment, age, etc. and physical proximity without compromising the user's home address and other personal information.  The project will be following the MERN stack with an emphasis on using NodeJS and the npm packages available.

### **M**ongoose 

###### I decided to use a no-sql database for [various reasons](https://www.mongodb.com/why-use-mongodb) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html) is the nodeJS package from MongoDB.  I believe using Mongoose will help make the project a success because the goal of the application is to have a social media platform that will scale with the number of users, their interaction with one another using websocket technology superimposed over a map driven interface.  This will involve a diverse and large amount of data and traffic.

__**Todo**__: design the project's data structure incorporating user data, map data and dynamic data traffic incorporating for both.


### **E**xpress

###### The decision to use [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as the back-end web application framework was made for me since I wanted this project to be build on NodeJS.



### **R**eact

##### I am most interested in using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end for building user interfaces and UI components because of its ability to transpile my code such that it will be compatibile with android and IOS devices.  Since this  project is still in the early stages I won't be working with React until many other milestones are achieved.



### **N**odeJS

###### I am attracted to NodeJS because it utilizes the V8 Javascript engine, its asynchronous utility and the large amount of open source data available.
